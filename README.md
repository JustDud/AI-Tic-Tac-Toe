# Machine Learning-Powered Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
Developed a Tic Tac Toe game featuring an opponent powered by a machine learning algorithm, specifically Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in game development, providing an interactive experience with a learning-driven opponent.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Opponent:** Utilizes Q-learning to adapt and improve strategies over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Pygame for an engaging graphical user experience.
- **Performance Metrics:** Achieves a win rate of over 80% against inexperienced players and a tie rate of approximately 90% against optimal human gameplay.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustDud/AI-Tic-Tac-Toe.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd AI-Tic-Tac-Toe
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the game using the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the machine learning-powered opponent.

## Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available, detailing development stages, bug fixes, evaluations, stakeholder feedback, and analysis. [View the Documentation](https://github.com/JustDud/AI-Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/main/Documentation.docx)

## Technologies Used

<h3>About</h3>
This project explores the classic game “Tic Tac Toe” (Noughts and Crosses) but with a twist—introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into the gameplay. The project focuses on key questions like, “How will the AI be implemented?” and “What happens when a human plays against AI?” The aim is to discover how AI evolves and potentially outperforms human players over time.

I chose this project to dive into a new, fascinating field—AI—which is becoming increasingly influential across industries, from medicine to autonomous driving. Through research and expert consultations, I’m developing this AI-enhanced version of Tic Tac Toe while gaining valuable insights into AI development and problem-solving. The outcome will demonstrate how AI influences a traditionally simple game and what the future holds for human-AI interactions.

<b>P.S.</b> All the infromation about the features and development of the project can be found in the document called "Documentation" with illustrations

<h3>Main Features</h3>

1. <b>Q-Learning Algorithm Implementation</b>
	•	Core Feature: Q-learning algorithm is used to train the computer to play Tic Tac Toe by rewarding the AI for making successful moves and punishing poor decisions.
	•	Q-Table: A matrix storing the learned state-action values, updated as the computer plays games and learns optimal strategies.

2. **Training and Learning Progress Visualisation**
	•	Graphs and Charts: The AI’s progress over time is illustrated with graphs showing key metrics.

3. **Simulation of Human vs AI and AI vs AI**
	•	Gameplay Simulation: Allow for human vs AI and AI vs AI games to showcase how the AI applies its learned strategies.

4. **Analytical Insights**
	•	Game Outcomes Analysis: Provide detailed analysis of each game, including:
	•	Moves made by both the human and AI players.
	•	Performance Metrics
