# Machine Learning-Powered Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
Developed a Tic Tac Toe game featuring an opponent powered by a machine learning algorithm, specifically Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in game development, providing an interactive experience with a learning-driven opponent.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Opponent:** Utilizes Q-learning to adapt and improve strategies over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Pygame for an engaging graphical user experience.
- **Performance Metrics:** Achieves a win rate of over 80% against inexperienced players and a tie rate of approximately 90% against optimal human gameplay.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustDud/AI-Tic-Tac-Toe.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd AI-Tic-Tac-Toe
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
